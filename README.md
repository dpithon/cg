Computer Graphics in Rust
=========================

Personal project aiming to :

1. Learn Rust
2. Learn and **understand** ray-tracing algorithms
3. Code a ray-tracer from scratch featuring :
    * CSG shapes
    * Refraction
    * Simple scene description language.

:warning: I **strongly** suggest to avoid using this code for anything serious.
